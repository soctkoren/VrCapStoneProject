# Vr Capstone project

## Summary
For the capstone project I have created a VR project that meets the following criteria in Fundamentals, Completeness and Challenges.

## Description of game
This game will be an endless runner game, where the player will be on a fixed path. The player will have a gun and they need to shoot certain objects on the fixed path to earn power ups, health, and other items to proceed in the game.

## Design Process
When design this game, I had a few initial concerns regarding motion sickness. I've seen VR games where the player is going down a hill and they need to dodge obstacles by moving their head left to right, however, I've heard that a lot of players experienced motion sickness. I really want a fast paced endless game, but I want to make sure the user does not feel any motion sickness. I will try two methods. One will be on a fixed track. As long as the player doesn't move left to right, I think it will be okay. If not I will make a teleportation system and checkpoints for gunfight challenges.

I also want to create a very Diegetic UI for the game. I feel that good UI is one that doesn't need explaining. My main strategy is to use colors and shapes as a main way to indicate some sort of interaction from the user. Also possibly limiting the users inputs is another way to make this possible.

Another important part of endless games are achievements for a sense of progression. I will create some incentives for players to revisit the game multiple times.

This document will be updated as the progress of this app evolves.

- 3D Modeling

## Challenges
- User Testing

User Test One:
inital designs for the game

User Chimi Kim
VR Experience Low

Question 1: What would you say your experience with VR is?
Not very good

Question 2: Do you like video games?
I do but I usually just play phone games

Question 3: Have you ever played endless games like temple run, if so what do you like about them?
Yeah I've played Temple run before. I like feeling like I'm getting better everytime I play it

Question 4: Do you get motion sickness?
Sometimes

Question 5: Looking at the inital designs, would it be fun to be a world like this?
yeah I can see it being fun

Question 6: Would you want to teleport around or have a auto pilot system?
Since I"m new to VR I would rather have an auto pilot system.

Question 7: Would it be fun if it was harder to hit the targets or easier?
Harder since games are more fun when they are harder.

### Summery from user testing 1
Looks like my inital designs seem doable, in scope and something that will hit all the requirements for the capstone project. Also, after this user test, I realized that most people these days play games on their phones, and a great way to get them to try out VR is give them something simlar. A game like Temple run is pretty straight foward, but one issue is motion sickness. If players move right to left on a auto pilot system very quickly, it is likely that they will get sick. I think the best way to get over this is to just move the player in a straight path, but just increase the speed slowly. For scoring I'm using targets and maybe other objects to hit with a gun. One thing I want to try out is using a bullet emitter vs a raycaster. I feel that raycasters dosen't have a bullet drop so it's pretty easy to hit targets with. With the popularity of Player Unknown Battle Grounds, I really like the bullet drop mechanic from that game. If I change it to have a more cartoony feel to my game and add bullet drop, it may feel like Splatoon gun game.
