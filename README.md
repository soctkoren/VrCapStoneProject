# Vr Capstone project

## Summary
For the capstone project I have created a VR project that meets the following criteria in Fundamentals, Completeness and Challenges.

## Description of game
This game will be an endless runner game, where the player will be on a fixed path. The player will have a gun and they need to shoot certain objects on the fixed path to earn power ups, health, and other items to proceed in the game.

## Design Process
When design this game, I had a few initial concerns regarding motion sickness. I've seen VR games where the player is going down a hill and they need to dodge obstacles by moving their head left to right, however, I've heard that a lot of players experienced motion sickness. I really want a fast paced endless game, but I want to make sure the user does not feel any motion sickness. I will try two methods. One will be on a fixed track. As long as the player doesn't move left to right, I think it will be okay. If not I will make a teleportation system and checkpoints for gunfight challenges.

I also want to create a very Diegetic UI for the game. I feel that good UI is one that doesn't need explaining. My main strategy is to use colors and shapes as a main way to indicate some sort of interaction from the user. Also possibly limiting the users inputs is another way to make this possible.

Another important part of endless games are achievements for a sense of progression. I will create some incentives for players to revisit the game multiple times.

This document will be updated as the progress of this app evolves.
